# expo template for vscode remote container

This is a basic template for getting started with expo in a container.

This template works on windows, setting the external ip is done via a batch file that sets a environment variable (MY_IP_ADDRESS).

It takes the first found IP (which works for me).

To create and start a new project:
![expo-cli](https://github.com/rkcda/vs-code-devcontainer-templates/raw/master/expo/expo-cli.gif)
